# Security Notes:
# - Never share your Discord bot token publicly
# - Use environment variables for sensitive data in production
# - Regularly rotate your Discord bot token
# - Monitor your Discord bot permissions

# Performance Tips:
# - Increase refresh rate for servers with many players
# - Use longer cache times for Discord data if you have many players
# - Monitor server performance and adjust settings accordingly
# - Consider using a dedicated Discord bot for large servers

# Troubleshooting:
# - If Discord integration isn't working, check your bot token and guild ID
# - If performance is poor, increase refresh rates and cache times
# - If players aren't showing, check your framework configuration
# - Enable debug mode temporarily to troubleshoot issues

# Support:
# - Check the README.md file for detailed configuration options
# - Review the config.example.lua file for advanced settings
# - Enable debug mode for detailed logging when troubleshooting
