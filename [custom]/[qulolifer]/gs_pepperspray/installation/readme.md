### There are two versions available for the pepperspray addon-weawpon, weapon_v1 and weapon_v2.
- weapon_v1: The original version as shown in the showcase video.
- weapon_v2: A new version, with a more extreme spray effect and is easier to install for inventory systems.

# V2 is recommended for new users (especially for non esx/qb/ox inventory systems), as it is easier to install!

# Switching version
By default, v1 will be used, you can switch from v1 to v2 by going to *fxmanifest.lua* and replacing all *weapon_v1* text with *weapon_v2*.
- Information for further installing the **v1** addon-weapon can be found in *v1_installation.md*
- Information for further installing the **v2** addon-weapon can be found in *v2_installation.md*

Be sure to fully restart the server after switching from versions!
